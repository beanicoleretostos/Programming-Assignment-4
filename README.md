# Programming-Assignment-4

#### **I. Intended Learning Outcomes:**
1. To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will
be used in data wrangling and data visualization

#### **II. Instructions:**
Download the ECE Board Exam 2 dataset found on this link: bit.ly/ECEBoardExamDataset and write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter notebook in the dedicated submission bin.
ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM: Using data wrangling and data visualization technique with storytelling, analyze the data and present different (i) data frames; and (ii) visuals using the dataset given.
> 1. Create the following data frames based on the format provided:
Example: Vis = [“Name”, “Gender”, “Track”, “Math<70”]; hometown is constant as Visayas
>> a. Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as Instrumentation and hometown Luzon
>> b. Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is constant as Mindanao and gender Female
> 2. Create a visualization that shows how the different features contributes to average grade. Does chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contributes to a higher average score?

#### **III. Obstacles**
- I have a lot of obstacles with this PA#4. I personally think that it is hard due to the fact that I wasn't able to understand everything.
- I have difficulties on finding the file path for reaading the excel file.
- I have to search youtube and blockmate for additional help when the syntax is not running because I only have limited time to do it.


#### **IV. Learnings I obtained while doing the activity**
- Some of the syntax become clear to me such as: .query - It helped me filter the data frame.
- I can easily understandd the data when it is visual and you can actually do it in python.
- (I will addd more Miss)
